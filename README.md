# GamepadManipulator
Control a 3 DOF robotic arm with an Xbox controller! This project uses a Python script to read gamepad inputs and send commands over serial to an Arduino Uno, which drives the arm's base, shoulder, and elbow servos. Includes a feature to record and replay movement sequences. Inspired by satellite docking systems.
