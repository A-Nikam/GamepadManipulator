GamepadManipulatorHey there! üëã This is my project where I built a 3 Degree of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm that you can control using an Xbox gamepad. Think of it as a mini version of those cool manipulator arms they use for things like satellite docking in space ‚Äì pretty neat, right?The magic happens with a Python script on your laptop talking to an Arduino Uno over a serial connection. The Arduino then tells the arm's base, shoulder, and elbow servos exactly where to go. Oh, and I added a handy feature to record your arm's movements and play them back!‚ú® What it Does (Features)3-Axis Control: You get control over the arm's twist (Base Yaw), how it lifts up and down (Shoulder Pitch), and how it bends in the middle (Elbow Pitch).Easy Gamepad Control: Grab your Xbox controller and start moving the arm in real-time ‚Äì it feels pretty natural!Talking to Arduino: The laptop and Arduino chat over a reliable serial connection to make things happen.Record Your Moves: You can capture a sequence of movements you make with the controller.Play it Back: Once recorded, you can have the arm repeat that exact sequence starting from where you began recording.Stay Safe with Limits: Software limits help make sure the arm doesn't try to go where it physically can't.Quick Reset: There's a way to quickly send the arm back to a starting 'home' position.üöÄ See it in Action![Optional: Add a link to a cool video or GIF here! Seriously, show off your robot!]üõ†Ô∏è What You'll Need (Hardware)To build your own version of this, you'll need these bits and pieces:The Arm Itself: Your 3 DOF arm frame (whether you 3D printed it, built it from a kit, etc.).Arduino Uno (Mini or standard): The brains on the robot side.MG995 Servos (x2): These are your workhorses for the shoulder and elbow ‚Äì they need a bit of strength!MG90S Servo (x1): A smaller one for the base twist.An Xbox Controller: Or another gamepad that plays nicely with Pygame.Your Laptop/Computer: Where the Python script lives.USB Cable: To link your Arduino to the laptop.Jumper Wires: For hooking everything up.Li-ion Batteries (x3): To give those power-hungry servos the juice they need. Make sure they can handle the current!Buck Converter: Super important! This steps down the battery voltage to a safe level for your servos (usually 5-6V).Power Connectors: To make your power setup safe and tidy.üíª Software You'll NeedMake sure you have this installed on your laptop:Python 3.x: The scripting language.Pygame: Helps read those gamepad inputs easily (pip install pygame).PySerial: Handles the talking to the Arduino (pip install pyserial).Arduino IDE: To get the code onto your Arduino.üîå Getting Everything Set UpReady to get this thing moving? Follow these steps:Put the Arm Together:Assemble your arm structure.Mount the little MG90S servo for the base rotation.Attach the two stronger MG995 servos for the shoulder and elbow joints.[Got any specific tips or steps for putting your arm together? Add them here!]Wire It Up:Connect your Li-ion batteries in a series to the input side of your buck converter.Take the output from the buck converter and connect it to the VCC and GND pins on all three of your servos. Seriously, don't try to power these servos from the Arduino's 5V pin ‚Äì they'll draw too much power!Connect the signal wire from the Base servo (MG90S) to Arduino Pin 9.Connect the signal wire from the Shoulder servo (MG995) to Arduino Pin 10.Connect the signal wire from the Elbow servo (MG995) to Arduino Pin 11.Make sure you connect a GND wire from your servo power setup (the buck converter output) to one of the GND pins on your Arduino. This common ground is essential!Plug your Arduino into your laptop with the USB cable.[This is a great spot to drop in a clear photo or diagram of your wiring!]Load Code onto Arduino:Open the arduino_code.ino file in the Arduino IDE.Pick the right board (Arduino Uno) and the correct serial port under the Tools menu.Just double-check that the pin numbers in the code (BASE_SERVO_PIN, etc.) match where you actually wired your servos.Make sure the SERIAL_BAUD_RATE (115200) matches the Python script.Hit upload!Get Python Ready:Open your terminal or command prompt.Run this command to install the libraries:pip install pygame pyserial
Tweak the Python Script:Open up python_controller.py in your favorite code editor.Important: Change the SERIAL_PORT line near the top to the port your Arduino is using. (Look in the Arduino IDE's Tools > Port if you're not sure). It'll look something like 'COM4' on Windows or '/dev/ttyACM0' on Linux/macOS.Feel free to play with BASE_STEP_DEG, SHOULDER_STEP_DEG, and ELBOW_STEP_DEG if you want the arm to move more or less with each button press.Check the servo limits (base_servo_min, etc.) and adjust them if needed to match how far your physical arm can safely move. Make sure these line up with the constrain values in the Arduino code!üéÆ How to Use ItAlright, everything's set up!Power Up: Double-check all your wiring and turn on the power for your servos (the battery pack and buck converter).Connect Gamepad: Plug in your Xbox controller.Run the Script: Open your terminal, go to the folder with python_controller.py, and run:python python_controller.py
You should see some messages pop up as it connects.Move the Arm! Use your controller:D-pad Up/Down: Moves the Shoulder.D-pad Left/Right: Twists the Base.'Y' Button: Bends the Elbow up.'A' Button: Straightens the Elbow down.Hold the Right Trigger: Sends the arm back to its starting 'home' spot.Press 'X': This is your record button!Press it once to start recording your movements.Press it again to stop recording. The arm will go back to where you started recording and then repeat the moves you just made!Done Playing? Hit Ctrl+C in the terminal to stop the Python script.üìÇ What's Inside (Code Structure)python_controller.py: This is the main script that listens to your gamepad, figures out where the arm should go, records movements, and talks to the Arduino.arduino_code.ino: This code lives on the Arduino, listens for commands from the laptop, and directly controls the servos.modified_3dof_arm.urdf: A file that describes the robot's parts and how they connect. Useful for visualizing the arm in simulation software.ü§ñ About the URDF ModelI included a modified_3dof_arm.urdf file. It's basically a description of the robot's bones and joints. I used it to get a better idea of how the arm should move and figure out the right limits for each joint, sometimes in a simulation environment.üí° What's Next? (Future Work)Got ideas for making this even cooler? Here are some thoughts:Add more joints (like a wrist or a gripper!) to make it more flexible.Teach it Inverse Kinematics so you can just tell the end of the arm where to go in 3D space.Move the whole thing over to ROS2 ‚Äì it's a powerful platform for serious robot stuff.Stick a camera on it and add some computer vision or AI so it can see and interact with things on its own.Build a nice graphical interface instead of just using the terminal.Let people save and load recorded movements to files.Improve the power system and maybe add a way to see how much battery is left.üìÑ LicenseThis project is open source under the MIT License.
