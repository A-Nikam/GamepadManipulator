# GamepadManipulator

This project presents a **3 Degree of Freedom (DOF) robotic manipulator** system controllable via an Xbox gamepad. It demonstrates real-time joint control and includes a feature for recording and replaying movement sequences. The system architecture involves a Python script for input processing and control logic, communicating serially with an Arduino Uno that directly drives the manipulator's servo motors. This project was inspired by the control principles used in robotic arms for tasks such as satellite docking.

## Features
- Full three-axis control: **Base yaw**, **Shoulder pitch**, and **Elbow pitch**, all managed via your Xbox controller through Pygame.
- Seamless communication between your laptop and Arduino via USB at a baud rate of **115200**.
- Precise position control for intuitive and responsive movements.

## Hardware Requirements
To get started, youâ€™ll need the following:
- A **3 DOF arm frame** (either 3D-printed or a kit).
- An **Arduino Uno** (mini or standard version).
- **Two MG995 servos** for the shoulder and elbow joints.
- **One MG90S servo** for the base.
- An **Xbox controller** (or any Pygame-compatible gamepad).

## Software Requirements
On your laptop, make sure you have:
- **Python 3.x** installed, along with the following packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame pyserial
